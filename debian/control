Package: python-brotli
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: lossless compression algorithm and format (Python 2 version)
 Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm
 that compresses data using a combination of a modern variant
 of the LZ77 algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling,
 with a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available
 general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with
 deflate but offers more dense compression.
 .
 This package installs a Python 2 module.
